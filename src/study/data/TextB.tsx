He threw on his snow pants and jacket, then dashed outside before his mom could even finish saying, "don’t forget your hat!"

But Jack was already at the hill. He took a deep breath in and began his climb, dragging his sled behind him. He climbed higher and higher until he finally reached the top. As he looked down, the hill felt so large to the 8-year-old Jack that it seemed like a mountain.

Without waiting another second, he positioned his sled strategically and loaded himself on. WOOSH!

He zoomed down the hill so fast that his hat flew right off his head.
He zoomed past all the children climbing the hill.
He zoomed past the parents waiting at the bottom of the hill. But he didn't slow down.
He zoomed faster and faster, and crashed into the hay bales.
He flew off his sled and into the air. He soared through the sky, flying past a flock of noisy geese.`
